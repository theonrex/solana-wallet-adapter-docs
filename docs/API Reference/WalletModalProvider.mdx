# WalletModalProvider

### What is WalletModalProvider
WalletModalProvider is a React component that enables a modal window for users to easily connect their wallets. By wrapping your application in this provider, it triggers a connection modal whenever a user needs to connect their wallet. This makes it simpler to integrate wallet connection features into your app without having to manage the modal logic manually.

### Props:
- children (ReactNode): These are the nested components that will have access to the wallet modal functionality. This prop allows you to render your app's UI while enabling wallet connection features globally.
**Example in layout.tsx:**
```tsx
import {  ReactNode } from "react";
import { WalletModalProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {

  return (
 <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
  );
}


```
