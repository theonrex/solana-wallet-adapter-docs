# WalletProvider

## What is WalletProvider?
WalletProvider is a React context provider that handles wallet connectivity for your Solana application. It allows users to connect their wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) and facilitates wallet-related operations like signing transactions or viewing balances.

### Props:


### wallets (Array):
An array of wallet adapters that your application supports. Wallet adapters are small code packages that bridge your app with specific wallets.

For example, to support the Phantom Wallet, you use the **PhantomWalletAdapter**. You can add more adapters depending on the wallets you want to support, such as:

- SolflareWalletAdapter
- TorusWalletAdapter

### autoConnect (boolean):
A flag indicating whether the application should automatically reconnect to the last wallet used when the page reloads. This improves user experience by reducing friction.

- true: Automatically reconnect to the last wallet used.
- false: Require users to manually reconnect their wallet.

### children (ReactNode):
These are the components that require wallet context. Any component wrapped inside WalletProvider gains access to the wallet connection state and functionality.



### **Example in layout.tsx:**
```tsx

import { WalletProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
import { PhantomWalletAdapter, TorusWalletAdapter , LedgerWalletAdapter} from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const wallets = [
    new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
    new TorusWalletAdapter(),
    new LedgerWalletAdapter(),
  ];

  return (
    <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
      {children}
    </WalletProvider>
  );
}


```

### Imports for Wallet Adapters
To use specific wallets in your Solana application, you directly import them as needed. Below is an organized way to import popular wallets based on their purpose or type.

### Popular Wallet Adapters
These are widely used wallets in the Solana ecosystem, known for ease of use and broad support.


```tsx

import { PhantomWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets'; // Phantom Wallet  
import { SolflareWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets'; // Solflare Wallet  
import { TorusWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets';   // Torus Wallet  


```

### Exchange-Related Wallets

These wallet adapters are from well-known crypto exchanges, often used for bridging across different blockchains or accessing exchange features.


``` tsx

### Hardware Wallets
Hardware wallets are physical devices used to store cryptocurrency keys securely, minimizing the risk of online attacks.

```tsx
